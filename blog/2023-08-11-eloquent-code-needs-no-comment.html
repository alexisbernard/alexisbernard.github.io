      <h2>Eloquent code needs no comment</h2>

      </p>

      <p>Yesterday, I was reviewing the following code :</p>

      <pre><code code class="language-ruby">
class Invoice::ResellerJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform
    # Do nothing if we are not the first of the month
    return unless Date.today.day == 1

    # Generate monthly invoices
    User.billed_monthly.each do |user|
      # ...
    end

    # Do nothing if we are not on the first day of the year
    return unless Date.today.month == 1

    # Generate yearly invoices
    User.billed_yearly.each do |user|
      # ...
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

    <p>
      Comments are often a tell that the code could be more explicit.
      Every time I write a comment, I refactor my code to be understandable without it.
      Furthermore, it requires to read all the lines of code to understand what this class does.
      Here is a version that should be more eloquent:
    </p>

    <pre><code code class="language-ruby">
class Invoice::ResellerJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform
    bill_monthly
    bill_yearly
  end

  def bill_monthly
    return if Date.today.day != 1
    User.billed_monthly.each do |user|
      # ...
    end
  end

  def bill_yearly
    return if Date.today.month != 1 || Date.today.day != 1
    User.billed_yearly.each do |user|
      # ...
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

    <p>
      Reading the 2nd version is quicker because you only have to scan the method names to understand what it does.
      Moreover, the return conditions are evident thanks to the method names above.

      Write the code the way you would like to read it in the future ;-)
