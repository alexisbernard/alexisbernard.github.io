      <h2>Tips to avoid RMagick memory leaks</h2>
      <p><time datetime="2014-11-27">November 27, 2014</time></p>
      <p>
        RMagick has a bad reputation because of memory leaks. I had memory leaks issue while working on
        <a href="http://disco.io/">DISCO.IO</a> where Ruby processes kept bloating.
        That issue was really annyoing since millions of pictures are resized.
        Finally I succeed to fix my code. Now memory usage is stable. Here is how I did it.
      </p>

      <p>TL;DR for hurry people:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call Magick::Image#destroy! (ensure block is a damn good idea)</li>
        <li>Use methods with exclamation mark as much as spossible</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here is the code before improvements:</p>

<pre><code>def resize_picture(data, size)
  picture = Magick::Image.from_blob(data).first

  if (min_size = [picture.rows, picture.columns].min) >= 360
    picture = picture.crop(Magick::CenterGravity, min_size, min_size)
  end

  picture = picture.resize_to_fill(size, size) if picture.rows > size
  result = normalize_picture(picture)
  picture.destroy!
  result
end</code></pre>

      <p>Here is the code after fixing memory leaks with changes in bold:</p>

<pre><code>def resize_picture(data, size)
  picture = Magick::Image.from_blob(data).first

  if (min_size = [picture.rows, picture.columns].min) >= 360
    picture.<strong>crop!</strong>(Magick::CenterGravity, min_size, min_size)
  end

  picture.<strong>resize_to_fill!</strong>(size, size) if picture.rows > size
  normalize_picture(picture)
<strong>ensure
  picture &amp;&amp; picture.destroy!</strong>
end</pre></code>

      <p>
        Calling the crop! instead of crop is a huge memory save, because the latter creates a copy the of the picture.
        Like the Ruby convention of Enumerable, Array and Hash, RMagick provides the 2 versions for all methods.
      </p>
      <p>Finally destroy! is called from an ensure block to free memory in case of any error.</p>
      <p>That is not really complicated and makes me really happy to stop Ruby processes from eating all the memory. I hope that will work for you too !</p>
