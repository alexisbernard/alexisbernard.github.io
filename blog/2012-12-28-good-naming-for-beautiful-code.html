      <h2>Good naming for a beautiful code</h2>
      <p><time datetime="2012-12-28">December 28, 2012</time></p>
      <p>Naming variables, methods and classes well helps teammates to easily understand your code. Indeed when a code is perfectly named you feel like almost reading english. Thus, it&#8217;s not necessery to read the documentation or the code of a method to understand what it does. It saves a lot of time and makes developers happier. I am going to explain how I try to choose a good name when I am writing Ruby.</p>
      <p>First I use a kind of grammar for naming variables, methods and classes. I use regular names for classes and variables. I start all my methods by a verb except when it&#8217;s an attribute accessor. When choosing a verb, I avoid to pick up set and get, because they are catch-all. Let&#8217;s take an example with a server instance providing data.</p>
<pre><code>server.data        # Read an attribute?
server.get_data    # Better but still bad
server.fetch_data  # Good name, I understand it goes through the network</code></pre>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that the last example is the most explicit naming. Indeed, I understand it retrieves data from the network, so it is explicit that call could be slow. However don&#8217;t go too deep in detail. If the name expose all the internal behavior and algorithme, then you went too far. When calling a method, we are interested by its result, not how it has been implemented.</p>
<p><pre><code>server.fetch_data_via_http # Callers usually doesn't care about internal behavior</code></pre></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to be consistent. Let&#8217;s say you have a cart object and the payment process has two steps. First it initializes the payment, then it confirms.</p>
<p><pre><code># Not consistent, because the calling order is not obvious
cart.authorize(...)
cart.purchase(...)</code></pre></p>
<p><pre><code># Consistent naming, because it makes clear that those methods are linked
cart.prepare_checkout(...)
cart.complete_checkout(...)
</code></pre></p>
<p>For variables I don&#8217;t prefix or suffix them with their type, because it generates noise. Most of the time names is connected to the variable type. I try to be accurate about the naming. If the code is dealing with a banned user I name it banned_user instead of just user.</p>
<p>Arguments order must not be disregarded. I use to put the most important argument in first, because it is directly related to the verb used by the method.</p>
<p><pre><code> # Which one makes more sens?
email.send_to(headers, users)
email.send_to(users, headers)
</code></pre></p>
<p>I try to avoid boolean parameters because they don&#8217;t have any sens when written litteraly.</p>
<p><pre><code># What means the last argument?
email.send_to(users, headers, true)
email.send_to(users, headers, signature: true)
</code></pre></p>
<p>I hope those small tips have been interesting.</p>
